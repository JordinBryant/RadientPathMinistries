              As reflected in the scriptures above, and in many others
              throughout the Bible, hair holds significant spiritual meaning. It
              is a symbol of beauty, identity, and divine connection. This is
              why it's essential to give it the utmost care and attention,
              recognizing its deeper value beyond just appearance.

            <h4>Tip #1: Use Natural Oils</h4>
            <p>
              Using natural oils like coconut oil can help nourish your scalp
              and hair.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div className="tip">
            <h4>Tip #2: Wash Less Frequently</h4>
            <p>
              Over-washing can strip your hair of natural oils. Try washing 2-3
              times a month.
            </p>

          <div className="tip">
            <h4>Tip #3: Finish Hair washing with cold water</h4>
            <p>
              Cold water can generally stimulate the production of white blood
              cells throughout the body, which are crucial for fighting
              infections, potentially boosting your overall immune system;
              therefore, indirectly supporting the immune response in your head
              as well.
